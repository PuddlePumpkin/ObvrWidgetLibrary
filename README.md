# ObvrWidgetLibrary

*Collection of remakes of Oblivion Remastered's UI prefab widgets for mod UIs.*

This repository contains recreations of the original UI widget prefabs with asset dummy's (the original textures and materials load only in game).
Someone may eventually figure out how to create functional dummy's of the original navigable prefabs, till then having an alternative is nice!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** *No original game assets (textures, meshes, or code) are included in this repository.*

This project is **NOT** associated with Bethesda, Zenimax, Virtuos or any of their subsidiaries!
